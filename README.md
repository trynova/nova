# Nova - Your favorite javascript and wasm engine

## :warning: This project is a Work In Progress, and is very far from being suitable for use :warning:

Nova is a [JavaScript](https://tc39.es/ecma262) and
[WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org) engine written in Rust.

The engine is exposed as a library with an API for implementation in Rust
projects which themselves must serve as a runtime for JavaScript code.
