/// ### [9.1.1.2 Object Environment Records](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-object-environment-records)
///
/// Each Object Environment Record is associated with an object called its
/// binding object. An Object Environment Record binds the set of string
/// identifier names that directly correspond to the property names of its
/// binding object. Property keys that are not strings in the form of an
/// IdentifierName are not included in the set of bound identifiers. Both own
/// and inherited properties are included in the set regardless of the setting
/// of their \[\[Enumerable\]\] attribute. Because properties can be dynamically
/// added and deleted from objects, the set of identifiers bound by an Object
/// Environment Record may potentially change as a side-effect of any operation
/// that adds or deletes properties. Any bindings that are created as a result
/// of such a side-effect are considered to be a mutable binding even if the
/// Writable attribute of the corresponding property is false. Immutable
/// bindings do not exist for Object Environment Records.
