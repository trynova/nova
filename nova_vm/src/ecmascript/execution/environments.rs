//! ### [9.1 Environment Records](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-environment-records)
//!
//! Environment Record is a specification type used to define the association of
//! Identifiers to specific variables and functions, based upon the lexical
//! nesting structure of ECMAScript code. Usually an Environment Record is
//! associated with some specific syntactic structure of ECMAScript code such as
//! a FunctionDeclaration, a BlockStatement, or a Catch clause of a
//! TryStatement. Each time such code is evaluated, a new Environment Record is
//! created to record the identifier bindings that are created by that code.
//!
//! Every Environment Record has an \[\[OuterEnv\]\] field, which is either null or
//! a reference to an outer Environment Record. This is used to model the
//! logical nesting of Environment Record values. The outer reference of an
//! (inner) Environment Record is a reference to the Environment Record that
//! logically surrounds the inner Environment Record. An outer Environment
//! Record may, of course, have its own outer Environment Record. An Environment
//! Record may serve as the outer environment for multiple inner Environment
//! Records. For example, if a FunctionDeclaration contains two nested
//! FunctionDeclarations then the Environment Records of each of the nested
//! functions will have as their outer Environment Record the Environment Record
//! of the current evaluation of the surrounding function.
